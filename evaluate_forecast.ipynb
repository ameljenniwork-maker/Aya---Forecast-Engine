    "# Forecast Performance Scorecard\n",
    "\n",
    "This scorecard provides a systematic, top-down approach to analyze forecast performance and identify areas for model improvement. The process follows a drill-down methodology from high-level business metrics to individual product analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scorecard Process Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Portfolio Overview** \n",
    "Start with the big picture - how is the entire business performing against forecasts? This gives you the overall health of your forecasting system and identifies if there are systematic issues affecting the whole portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Category Performance Analysis**\n",
    "Drill down into sales categories (Very Low, Low, Alive, Medium, Winning, High Winning) to identify which product segments are driving forecast errors. This helps prioritize which categories need immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Error Distribution Deep Dive**\n",
    "For problematic categories, analyze the distribution of forecast errors to understand:\n",
    "- Are we consistently over-forecasting or under-forecasting?\n",
    "- What's the magnitude of errors?\n",
    "- Which products are the biggest contributors to poor performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Individual Product Investigation**\n",
    "Focus on the worst-performing products to understand root causes:\n",
    "- Are there data quality issues?\n",
    "- Is the product experiencing unusual patterns (promotions, stockouts, seasonality)?\n",
    "- Are there external factors affecting demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Actionable Insights Generation**\n",
    "Based on the analysis, identify specific actions:\n",
    "- Which products need model retraining?\n",
    "- What data quality issues need fixing?\n",
    "- Which categories need different forecasting approaches?\n",
    "- What external factors should be incorporated into the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Scorecard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the complete notebook** to get the full analysis\n",
    "2. **Start with the business-level view** to understand overall performance\n",
    "3. **Identify problematic categories** using the error distribution plots\n",
    "4. **Drill down into specific products** that are driving poor performance\n",
    "5. **Document findings** walk through lots of skus and identofy dominnat issues then correct. Don't focus on correcting specific edge cases. This will end up messing working cases\n",
